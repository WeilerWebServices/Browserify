This page lists various tools that either use browserify or add features to it.

## Task runners
- [grunt-browserify] - [Grunt] task for node-browserify.
- [broccoli-browserify] - Browserify plugin for [Broccoli].
- Using [Gulp]? There is a [recipe].

## Compiling for Development

There are two main ways that people like to recompile browserify bundles automatically as the files change. One way is to generate bundles on the fly attached to an existing web server. Another way is to run a standalone command or module that will only watch for changes and write to disk with the latest output.

### Web Server Tools

- [amok] serves your bundles with live editing capabilities
- [appup] launch apps that use an express main server and an optional restify api server and bundle with browserify
- [beefy] a local development server designed to work with browserify which creates bundles on demand
- [bfydir] is like [beefy] but different: you can run *one* server to bundle multiple `*.js`-files simultaneously (via [watchify])
- [browserify-middleware] host your bundles as middleware via express or connect
- [budo] a local development server focused on incremental bundling and LiveReloading JS/CSS
- [connect-browserify] provides yet another express/connect middleware for browserify which can rebuild a bundle automatically on source changes (uses watchify internally)
- [enchilada] host your bundles as middleware via express or connect
- [sprockets-browserify] Serve node modules though Sprockets using browserify

### Standalone Tools

- [parcelify](https://github.com/rotundasoftware/parcelify) Output css or other bundles based on the browserify dependency graph.
- [refreshify](https://github.com/alexanderGugel/refreshify) is like watchify, but has desktop notifications and live-reload built in
- [watchify] efficiently re-compile the bundle automatically when you edit files

### Dynamic loader in the browser
- [browserify-loader2](https://github.com/zengfenfei/browserify-loader) A loader like requirejs to help you load browserify modules without bundling.

## Compiler Pipeline

These tools fit somewhere into the pipeline of `module-deps | insert-module-globals | browser-pack` that browserify sets up internally or deal with `module-deps` json output or input directly. You can use these tools to build your own browserify more suited to your specific needs.

- [browser-pack] - generate a bundle of javascript from [module-deps] json input
- [browser-unpack] - create [module-deps]-formatted output from an existing bundle file
- [factor-bundle] - consume [module-deps] input, splitting out each entry file into a separate bundle and factoring out the modules held in common by multiple bundles
- [insert-module-globals] - transform [module-deps] input to insert browser shims for `Buffer`, `__filename`, `__dirname`, and `global`
- [intreq] - transform `require('string')` to `require(n)` in a [module-deps] stream to save bytes
- [module-deps] - create json output from entry files that can be fed into browser-pack

## Bundle Tools

These tools accept a bundle file generated by [browserify] or [browser-pack] as input.

- [browser-unpack] - create [module-deps]-formatted output from an existing bundle file
- [derequire] - replace `require()` calls with `_dereq_()` so that bundles can be required by browserify or similar static analysis tools again. This module was used in `browserify --standalone` pre v5.
- [disc] - visualise the module tree of browserify project bundles and track down bloat.
- [exorcist] pull the source map found inside a stream into an external `.js.map` file
- [bundle-collapser] - compress require paths for better minification i.e. `require('some/long/path')` => `require(1)`

## Testing

- [karma-bro] bundle test files via browserify when being run with [karma]
- [mochify] TDD for browserified code with Mocha, PhantomJS and WebDriver
- [proxyquireify] proxy browserify's require in order to override dependencies while testing
- [testling] run [testling-ci] tests locally.
- [zuul] run your test suite in many browsers without having them installed locally
- [smokestack] do `browserify test.js | smokestack`; your tests will run locally, and you'll get console output in your terminal

## Refactoring

- [browserify-ftw] refactor requirejs AMD projects to work with browserify

## Other tools

- [cartero](https://github.com/rotundasoftware/cartero/) full asset pipeline based on commonjs and browserify.
- [xcss] plugin for browserify collects all `require()` calls which reference stylesheets and bundle them into a separate CSS bundle.
- [reduce-js] a wrapper for browserify and watchify to work more gulpishly.

## Plugins

- [css-modulesify](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modulesify): A browserify plugin to load CSS Modules. (_Please note that this is still highly experimental._)

## Transform Helpers

- [browserify-transform-tools] a library of handy functions for loading configuration and generating transforms
